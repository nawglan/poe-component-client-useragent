Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::UserAgent is an asynchronous, event driven
LWP and LWP::Parallel based user agent POE component. It lets other
tasks run while making a request to an Internet server and waiting
for a response, and it lets several requests run in parallel.

Requirements
------------

This module requires POE, LWP and LWP::Parallel. The component
requires POE version 0.1402 and LWP::Parallel version 2.51,
which in turn requires LWP version 2.52 or 2.53.

Availability
------------

The most recent POE::Component::Client::UserAgent version
is available on CPAN:

http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=POE-Component-Client-UserAgent

Installation
------------

Create a makefile:

  perl Makefile.PL

Install the module:

  make install

Alternatively you can install the component using CPAN shell.

You can also extract the archive manually. The component is written
entirely in Perl and requires no compilation.

Testing
-------

Run all test scripts:

  make test

If any of the test scripts fails, please run the script like so:

  perl 00test.t 9

where 00test.t is the name of the script that fails and the number
9 is the debug level. This will create a file with the same name
as the script and a .log extension. Then send the .log file to the
component author.

Usage
-----

An example of usage is found in the built in POD documentation.

Test scripts are also good examples of the component usage.
